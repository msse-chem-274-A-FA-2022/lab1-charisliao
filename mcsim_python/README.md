# Quesitons from the Jupyter Notebook    

### 3. What are the difference you see between (1) and (2). Why do you think these differences occur? For your RDF, you will see nonzero values close to zero distance. Does this make sense physically? (as in, would particles ever be this close?)

For the step number V.S. Energy per Particle, there was only one dot for (2) and there were multiple dots for (1). For the RDF graphs, (1) generates a prettier trend with less noise. For example, it was clear that there's a dip between 1 and 2, then the graph eventually converges to one. However, in (2), tehre were lots of noise even though the graph also eventually converged to one.  

The differences occur because there was not much equilibration in (2) which caused the configurations generated in (2) not optimal. Therefore, lots of noise occured in (2).      

This does not make sense physically because this means that particles are overlapping, but in reality, this is not possible.      

### 4. Repeat (1) with a system density of 0.009 and compare the RDF. Note the location of the peak and the shape of the graph. challenge Plot two rdfs on the same plot. This will require you to save the rdfs with different variable names and to change the name of the saved figure.
